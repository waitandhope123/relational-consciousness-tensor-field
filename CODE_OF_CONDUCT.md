# Code of Conduct

This project is dedicated to respectful, evidence-based technical discussion.

Harassment, personal attacks, or bad-faith engagement are not tolerated.
Disagreements are expected, but must focus on falsification, reproducibility,
or technical clarity rather than personal belief or intent.

Participants are expected to engage professionally and in good faith.
Maintainers reserve the right to moderate or remove content that does not
align with these standards.
