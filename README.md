# Relational Consciousness Tensor Field v1.2

Falsifiable phenomenological model proposing a physical correlate for anomalous information access.

> ⚠️ **Scope Notice**
> This repository contains a **phenomenological proposal and toy consistency checks only**.
> It does **not** establish empirical truth, validate psychic claims, or derive new physics.
> All claims are explicitly falsifiable and pending independent replication.

---

## Status
- **Code**: `T01_final_v2.ipynb` — toy consistency checks (runnable)
- **arXiv**: quant-ph (submission pending)
- **Prediction**: anomalous force residual  
  **ΔF_anom ≈ 10 pN** (cryo-AFM, sphere–plane, 100 nm)

---

## What This Is
- A **phenomenological model**, not a fundamental theory
- A framework with **explicit failure modes**
- A proposal designed to be **experimentally killable**

## What This Is Not
- Not a proof of consciousness physics
- Not validation of reported psychic data
- Not a claim of new forces or violations of relativity

---

## Core Claims
- Directed tensor \( C^\mu_{ij} \) defined on abstract ψ-space
- Antisymmetry: \( C_{ij} = -C_{ji} \), enforcing **self-blindness** \( C_{ii}=0 \)
- Operational **no-signaling** (spacelike commutation enforced)
- Four explicit, calibration-aware falsification criteria
- Consistency with *reported* P-data (appendix), pending independent replication
