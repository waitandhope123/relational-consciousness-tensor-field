# Theoretical Framework

This document freezes the **model assumptions and scope**.  
Nothing here should be read as derived fundamental physics.

## Indexing Conventions
- Indices **i, j** label abstract ψ-space entities (not spacetime points)
- Index **μ** denotes spacetime components where applicable

## Empirical Constraints (Motivating, Not Proving)

| Observation        | Rules Out        | Constrains Model To        |
|--------------------|------------------|----------------------------|
| Unknown details    | Cold reading     | Global ψ-indexing          |
| Self-blind access  | Cognitive bias   | $C_{ii}=0$                 |
| Sub-second timing  | Neural latency   | Pre-geometric correlations |

These constraints **motivate** the model; they do not uniquely imply it.

## Phenomenological Action

The illustrative effective action is written as

$$S_{\mathrm{eff}}=\int d^4x\sqrt{-g}\left[R+\alpha\,C_{ij}\nabla^2 C^{ij}+\beta\,F^{ij}_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}_{ij}\right]$$

The action is illustrative only and serves to encode the stated axioms at the level of an effective field description.

## Axioms (Phenomenologically Motivated)

- **Antisymmetry**: $C_{ij}=-C_{ji}$
- **Self-blindness**: $C_{ii}=0$
- **No-signaling**: $[C_{ij}(x),C_{kl}(y)]=0$ for $|x-y|>ct$ (operationally enforced)

No axiom is claimed to be derived from first principles.

## Scope and Status
- Effective phenomenological model
- No claim of completeness or uniqueness
- Valid only insofar as it survives its stated experimental falsification criteria
