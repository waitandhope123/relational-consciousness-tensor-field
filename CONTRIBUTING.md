# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project.

Contributions are welcome **only** in forms that preserve the project’s
falsifiability-first, phenomenological scope.

## Accepted Contributions

The following types of contributions are welcome:

- Bug fixes or technical improvements to toy consistency notebooks
- Corrections or improvements to documentation clarity or formatting
- Clarifications to experimental or measurement protocols
- Reproducibility, robustness, or falsification-oriented tests

## Not Accepted

The following types of contributions will not be accepted:

- Philosophical or interpretive debates
- Claims of proof, validation, or empirical confirmation
- Speculative theoretical extensions without explicit falsification criteria
- Scope expansion beyond the stated experimental observable

## Guiding Principle

All contributions must preserve the project’s core principle:

> **The model is defined by its falsifiability.**
> Contributions should clarify, test, or potentially falsify the proposal —
> not reinterpret or justify it.

Thank you for helping keep the project precise, testable, and reproducible.
